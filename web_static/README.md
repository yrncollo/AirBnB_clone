# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

## Background Context

** Web static, what?**

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything

## Objectives

To be able to explain:

- What is HTML?
- How do you create an HTML page?
- What is a markup language?
- What is the DOM?
- What is an element / tag?
- What is an attribute?
- How does the browser load a webpage?
- What is CSS?
- How do you add style to an element?
- What is a class?
- What is a selector?
- How do you compute CSS Specificity Value?
- What are Box properties in CSS?
- To ensure all the code is W3C compliant by validating with [W3C-Validator](https://github.com/holbertonschool/W3C-Validator)
